<overview>
Plans execute autonomously. Checkpoints formalize interaction points where human verification or decisions are needed.

**Core principle:** Claude automates everything with CLI/API. Checkpoints are for verification and decisions, not manual work.

**Core rules:**
1. **If Claude can run it, Claude runs it** - Never ask user to execute CLI commands, start servers, or run builds
2. **Claude sets up the verification environment** - Start dev servers, seed databases, configure env vars
3. **User only does what requires human judgment** - Visual checks, UX evaluation, "does this feel right?"
4. **Secrets come from user, automation comes from Claude** - Ask for API keys, then Claude uses them via CLI
5. **Auto-mode bypasses verification/decision checkpoints** — When `workflow._auto_chain_active` or `workflow.auto_advance` is true in config: human-verify auto-approves, decision auto-selects first option, human-action still stops (auth gates cannot be automated)
</overview>

<checkpoint_types>

<type name="human-verify">
## checkpoint:human-verify (Most Common - 90%)

**When:** Claude completed automated work, human confirms it works correctly.

**Use for:**
- Visual UI checks (layout, styling, responsiveness)
- Interactive flows (click through wizard, test user flows)
- Functional verification (feature works as expected)
- Audio/video playback quality
- Animation smoothness
- Accessibility testing

**Structure:**

**Example: UI Component (shows key pattern: Claude starts server BEFORE checkpoint)**

**Example: Xcode Build**
</type>

<type name="decision">
## checkpoint:decision (9%)

**When:** Human must make choice that affects implementation direction.

**Use for:**
- Technology selection (which auth provider, which database)
- Architecture decisions (monorepo vs separate repos)
- Design choices (color scheme, layout approach)
- Feature prioritization (which variant to build)
- Data model decisions (schema structure)

**Structure:**

**Example: Auth Provider Selection**

**Example: Database Selection**
</type>

<type name="human-action">
## checkpoint:human-action (1% - Rare)

**When:** Action has NO CLI/API and requires human-only interaction, OR Claude hit an authentication gate during automation.

**Use ONLY for:**
- **Authentication gates** - Claude tried CLI/API but needs credentials (this is NOT a failure)
- Email verification links (clicking email)
- SMS 2FA codes (phone verification)
- Manual account approvals (platform requires human review)
- Credit card 3D Secure flows (web-based payment authorization)
- OAuth app approvals (web-based approval)

**Do NOT use for pre-planned manual work:**
- Deploying (use CLI - auth gate if needed)
- Creating webhooks/databases (use API/CLI - auth gate if needed)
- Running builds/tests (use Bash tool)
- Creating files (use Write tool)

**Structure:**

**Example: Email Verification**

**Example: Authentication Gate (Dynamic Checkpoint)**

**Key distinction:** Auth gates are created dynamically when Claude encounters auth errors. NOT pre-planned — Claude automates first, asks for credentials only when blocked.

<summary>

Checkpoints formalize human-in-the-loop points for verification and decisions, not manual work.

**The core rule:** If Claude CAN automate it, Claude MUST automate it.

**Checkpoint priority:**
1. **checkpoint:human-verify** (90%) - Claude automated everything, human confirms visual/functional correctness
2. **checkpoint:decision** (9%) - Human makes architectural/technology choices
3. **checkpoint:human-action** (1%) - Truly unavoidable manual steps with no API/CLI

**When NOT to use checkpoints:**
- Things Claude can verify programmatically (tests, builds)
- File operations (Claude can read files)
- Code correctness (tests and static analysis)
- Anything automatable via CLI/API
